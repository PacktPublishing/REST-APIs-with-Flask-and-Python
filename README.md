## About the Video Course
Are you tired of boring, outdated, incomplete, or incorrect tutorials? I say no more to copy-pasting code that you don’t understand. Welcome to one of the best resources online on creating REST APIs. I'm Jose, and I'm a software engineer; here to help you truly understand and develop your skills in web and REST API development with Python. Production-ready REST APIs. This course will guide you in creating simple, intermediate, and advanced REST APIs including authentication, deployments, caching, and much more. We'll start with a Python refresher that will take you from the very basics to some of the most advanced features of Python—for you to never be lost or confused. Using Flask and popular extensions Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy we will dive right into developing complete, solid, production-ready REST APIs. We will also look into essential technologies Git, Heroku, nginx, and Varnish. I pride myself in providing excellent support and feedback to every single student. I am always available to guide you personally, and answer questions for your benefit.Don't wait, and sign up today to take another step toward web services mastery!I'll see you on the inside.
